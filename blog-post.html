  <h1>Why I Am Leaving Barbering For Tech</h1>

  <p>I have been a barber for about 11 years now. I am currently in school for coding in hopes to better my life. Here are some reasons why I want to make the switch.</p>

  <h1>My back hurts. A lot.</h1>

  <p>Barbering puts a lot of strain on my body as I am constantly standing and putting strain on my neck and shoulders. I also have been in two car accidents in the last few years which has made barbering more difficult. </p>

  <p>Here is a list of things that will improve when I have less back pain from work:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Long distance cycling</li>
    <li>Better sleep</li>
    <li>Less chiropractor visits</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>I need more money than I make now</h1>
  <p>I am turning 30 this year and have been thinking a lot more about what I want my future to look like. I realized that I dont want to be working as a barber for the rest of my life.</p>

  <p>These are some examples of what I plan to do with a better income:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Pay off debt and start a savings & retirement</li>
    <li>Eventually buy property</li>
    <li>Take more time off</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>I want to work from home</h1>
  <p></p>
