    <title>Why I am leaving barbering for tech</title>
  </head>
<body>
  <p>I have been a barber for about 11 years now. I am currently in school for coding in hopes to better my life. Here are some reasons why I want to make the switch.</p>
  <h1>My back hurts. A lot.</h1>
  <p>Barbering puts a lot of strain on my body as I am constantly standing and putting strain on my neck and shoulders. I also have been in two car accidents in the last few years which has made barbering more difficult. </p>
  <h1>I need more money than I make now</h1>
  <p></p>
  <h1>I want ot travel more</h1>
  <p></p>
